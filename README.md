Color Image Enhancement Using Dynamic Linear Piecewise Transformation

This is my personal project for the image processing course.

Abstractâ€”When images are captured under the low-light or over-bright situations, those images will result in low visibility. This problem may cause not a difficulty for human perception but also the degradation of the performance for further computer vision or multimedia processing techniques. For this reason, a simple but effective enhancement is proposed to pleasing perceptual quality images. Also, to evaluate the results from this method, some challenging images both in low-light and overexposure conditions are used in the experiment, and besides judging human perception which is subjective to personal experiences, LOE is used as an objectives measurement metric to evaluate the results.
